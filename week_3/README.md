# 02D Final design, prototype and presentation

## Design

### Habitat SVG Design

<p>I designed the habitat legend, using lines and rectangles. Therefore, they can be easily transformed into SVGs. They are all designed based on the natural environment of that area.</p>

### Animal SVG Design

<p>There are 48 animals in total in which each animal has a very unique apperance. However, having too many icons may cause a confusion. Therefore, I grouped each animals according to the species and that give me the result of 23 species. </p>
  
<p>For example, African Elephant has bigger ears than the Bornean Elephant but both of them are elephant and therefore, they can share the elephant icon.</p>
