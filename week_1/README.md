# 02A Concept & Sketches

### Sketch 1

<p>The idea is to show <b>the connection between each SDG goals.</b> In each country, the priority and urgency of each goal is different. For example, developing countries would focus on equality goals, while developed country could focus on innovation goals.</p>
<p>I personally like the visual design of having multiple layers (of the goals), ideally, they should be in a semi-transparent colours, stacking on top of each other and swiping the order according to the selected option e.g. countries. However, there is no meaningful insight in this sketch.</p>

### Sketch 2

<p>This qualitative data focuses on <b> the types of natural disaster </b>that occur in each years.</p>
<p>Instead of displaying a numeral information, for example: 10 wildfires, 10 storms and 5 earthquakes in 1990, I visualise the events with colour code. </p>

### Sketch 3

<p>This qualitative data visualise <b> the species directory of endangered animal </b> listed by World Wildlife Fund (WWF), which is partnering with the UN organisation.</p>
<p>There are <b>4</b> variables included in this sketch; 
  <ol>
  <li> <b>Status:</b> Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable and	Near Threatened</li> 
  <li> <b>Type of animal:</b> Herbivore, Omnivore and Carnivore <i>- Because each type of animal plays a signifcant rule in the food chain. If they become extincted, the affect on the ecosystem is different. I was consider dividing the types of animal into prey-predator category. However, this won't work efficiently because an animal can be both prey and predator.</i></li>
  <li> <b>Threat:</b> Illegal wildlife trade, Overfishing, Habitat loss and etc</li> 
  <li> <b>Species information:</b> Population Size and Habitat</li> 
  </ol>
</p>
<p>I aim to create a simple visualisation with "line" and "rectangle", combining the scrollytelling technique.</p>
