## Endangered Animal and Global Threats

<p>WWF collaborates with UN to protecting endangered spaces and addressing global threats. The related Sustainable Development Goals are Goal 12: Sustainable Consumption and Production, Goal 13: Climate Action and Goal 14: Life Below Water.

## Data Planning

The four variables are conservation status, species (by habitat), threats and why they matter information. 

Observations
<ul>
<li>All animal has at least one threat</li>
<li>Most of them have more than one threats</li>
<li>The threats are varies according to each habitats. For example, the top forest threats are illegal wildlife trade, habitat loss and elephant conflict, while the top ocean threats are climate change, by catch and gas development.
</ul>
